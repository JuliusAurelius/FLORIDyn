# FLORIDyn
Dynamic implementation of the FLORIS model including time varying wind speeds and directions.

*WORK IN PROGRESS*

Pre-alpha version of a dynamic FLORIS implementation including time varying wind speeds and directions.
The program aims to provide interfaces to various models such as the Bastankhah(2016) model or the Gebraad(2014) model. It also aims to be similar to the FLORISSE_M implementation by TU Delft.

This code is part of the master thesis of Marcus Becker.
